                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>In this sector we will be exploring the bio section of tinder and how to maximize its potential to get you matches</li>
                    <li>Although the bio section is most likely not going to be the direct cause of a right swipe, it is definitely a necessity in any good profile</li>
                    <li>So what is it?</li>
                    <li>The “bio” or “about section” is a small amount of space provided for you to say something about yourself</li>
                    <li>The bio section is your opportunity to win over a potential match who is already pretty interested or unable to make a decision just based on your photos</li>
                    <li>A good bio can help secure those matches by giving your profile that extra edge</li>
                    <li>Likewise, if not given the proper attention, the bio can be the direct cause of a left swipe even if you’ve already won the potential match over with your photos</li>



                </ul>



            </section>




            <section id="bio">
                <h3>The Basic Bio</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>With a strong set of photos, an elaborate bio isn’t really needed but it can help</li>
                    <li>The key to a basic bio is to convey who you are in the simplest way possible

                    </li>
                    <li>This includes a few significant facts about you that’ll spark some interest

                    </li>
                    <li>Basically an informal resume</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">School you attended</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">What you studied</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Occupation</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">City you’re from (this applies heavily if you are traveling)</li>
                    <li>Personal interests that convey the image you are trying to present</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Hobbies</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Sports</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Taste in food</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Pets you are interested in or may have</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">If you’re over 6’1”, include your height for obvious reasons</li>

                    <li>The goal of the basic bio is to let your potential match know that not only are you not crazy, but you may be relatable. This will spark interest and make them want to know more about you</li>
                    <li>Keeping it short and to the point will make your bio easier to view and strike curiosity within your potential matches. It should all be readable with one glance</li>
                    <li>While at the same time keeping it short will aid in keeping it broad and hence, attract a wider range of matches</li>


                    <li>
                        <h4>Basic bio template: A</h4></li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Location, career, hobby Boston, graphic designer, dog lover</li>

                <h3>The Bad Bio</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>Just as easy as it is for some one to write a successful bio, it’s also very easy for them to mess it up, causing you to lose potential matches</li>
                    <li>The first and easiest mistake to make is leaving your bio blank</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Don’t EVER leave your bio blank. It says a lot about someone when they aren’t willing to share even one piece of basic information about themselves.</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">So unless you’ve got a face like Brad Pitt and abs like Jesus, just write a bio; its really not that hard</li>
                    <li>Aside from the obvious such as spelling errors, refrain from using any profanity (unless needed for humor), acronyms or emojis. No fuck, shit, cunts, LOLs, DTFs, :), X0, :P or images of waves that indicate you grew up by the water. These things wont make you distinguished and give of a sense of an immature lack of social awareness, which is basically a death sentence on tinder</li>
                    <li>Quotes in a bio can be tricky. If done right they can be very successful, but if done wrong, you’re shooting yourself in the foot</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">A quote that makes too specific of a reference may appeal to the few who share that interest, but it will not resonate with the masses. In the long run you’re limiting yourself, and being interested in the same author or musician doesn’t necessarily mean love at first sight. And if you pick a quote that is widely known in hopes that you’ll resonate with more people, it means the quote is over-used and you end up labeling yourself the worst thing possible… generic. Later on we’ll take a closer look at quotes and how to use them successfully</li>
                    <li>If it already says what school you go to or where you work, its redundant to repeat it in your bio</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Also don’t write out any links to social media, they give you the option to link your Instagram account so if you want people to view, there’s no point in writing it out</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">As for other social media sites, no one’s going to make the effort, especially if they aren’t going to swipe right</li>
                    <li>Avoid blatantly pointing out anything you don’t like or being too specific with what your interests in other people are. Basically don’t be rude, unless in an obvious joking manner</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">E.g.; I’m only interested in girls over so and so height</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">This app is pretty lame</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I don’t do blondes/I’m really into blondes</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">If we match don’t be weird</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Swipe left if you’re just going to be stuck up</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Refrain from any negativity or judgment at all unless it in an obvious joking manner, but more on that later</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Self deprecating statements</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I don’t have much free time</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I’m not good at dating</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I’ve had so and so happen to me</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I hate my job</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Unless its part of a joke, don’t acknowledge the app itself or what your opinion on it is</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I don’t really take this app too seriously (it’s good to convey that you don’t take this too seriously, but showing and saying are two different things. So show don’t tell)</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Hello tinder world!</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">My friends forced me to make this</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I’m usually above social media</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I have no idea how this works</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I’m new to this so bare with me</li>
                    <li>Making any type of demand or suggestion while acknowledging the app is a terrible idea</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Swipe right for a good time</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Message me so we can hang out</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">If we match lets talk</li>
                    <li>Probably the most common mistake is stating what you are trying to gain from the app</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I’m just looking to have fun with some cool people who like adventures

                    </li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Looking for something casual</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Not looking for anything serious</li>
                    <li>If you ever fined that in your own life, whenever you say a certain thing about yourself, others frequently have a distaste for it, refrain from mentioning it</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">For example, your love for country music or death metal</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">It is encouraged to be yourself, but at this point it’s a little too early to completely open up especially if you know it will turn potential matches away</li>
                    <li>Sexual statements in your bio are also very difficult to pull off. In most cases just avoid it because in most cases it will label you as creepy</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I love cleavage and yoga pants</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Hey sexy ladies</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Lets get weird</li>
                    <li>Avoid anything that gets too long or too personal</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Acknowledging your age in any way whatsoever</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Life stories</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Any type of family information</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Your zodiac sign</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Details about your ex</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Your political or religious or sports related beliefs</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Your shitty relationship with your parents</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Your financial situation</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Shouting anything out</li>
                    <li class="list-double-indent">Your sports team/army platoon/college (it already says you went there)</li>
                    <li>Having things in common with some one will increase the odds that they will swipe right, but again, the masses wont resonate with specific details so you end up limiting yourself for the sake of a select few people</li>
                    <li>Having things in common with some one will increase the odds that they will swipe right, but again, the masses wont resonate with specific details so you end up limiting yourself for the sake of a select few people</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">If the photo needs to be acknowledged, it’s not strong enough</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">It’s asking for a lot from someone to put a story together about your profile; it’s like trying to explain an inside joke</li>
                    <li>It’s okay if you drink or party but just don’t talk about it in your bio; it makes it seem like that’s what your life revolves around. And even if your life does revolve around that stuff, you shouldn’t say it</li>
                    <li>Basically, if you wouldn’t say it to someone you just met, don’t say it in your bio</li>
                    <li>Refrain from self promoting language to describe your personality. With things like this, its better to show, not tell</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I’m really funny</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I’m a deep/nice/sweet/sensitive/outgoing person/sarcastic/cool/open minded/well traveled/athletic/laid back… person</li>

                    <li>If it looks like it should be on a hallmark card or in a romantic comedy, don’t use it</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Life is complicated, love is simple</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I enjoy long walks on the beach</li>

                    <li class="list-double-indent">In the cases of travel show, don’t tell</li>
                    <li>Stay away from the cliché or cheesy unless it’s in an obvious joking manner. This will be elaborated on more later on</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Using words like adventure</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">I’m into fitness and working out</li>

                <h3>The Humorous Bio</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>One of the general truths about the bio is that if the potential match is on the fence after looking at your photos, and you make her laugh with your bio, you’ve pretty much guaranteed a right swipe</li>
                    <li>Humor when used right in the bio will always strengthen your profile. Using humor shows the potential match that you are relatable and have a strong sense of social awareness</li>
                    <li>Implement your humor in a way that is funny but avoids any characteristics of a bad bio</li>
                    <li>If the joke is very, very short, you can put a couple of them on there, just make sure it’s not too crowded</li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Examples of a humorous bio</h4></li>

                <h3>Perfecting The Tinder Bio</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>The key to the perfect bio is balance</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">You want to be factual but not too serious</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">You want to be funny but still show you are socially aware</li>
                    <li>A basic bio combined with a strong set of photos is a combination that will make up a good profile. Same thing goes for a strong set of photos and a good humorous bio. But if you want to push your bio to the point of perfection and have your profile stand out from the rest, the key is to combine both into one.</li>

                    <li>First if needed, lighten up one aspect of the factual parts of your basic bio to give it a softer tone so it syncs better with the humorous one</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Instead of: loves dogs and sushi</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Try: dog lover by day, sushi lover by night</li>

                    <li class="list-indent">Instead of: enjoys yoga</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Try: sometimes I sit on a mat and stretch for an hour then call it yoga</li>
                    <li>The end result should be something like this:</li>

                    <li class="list-indent">Boston based graphic designer, dog lover by day, sushi lover by night

                    </li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Amateur surfer. Sometimes I sit on a mat and stretch for an hour then call it yoga</li>
                    <li>If the factual information is exciting on its own, which in a lot of cases it is, lightening it up won’t really be necessary. The point of this is to smooth the transition into the joke. If it already sounds good, you don’t need to do it</li>

                    <li class="list-indent">Instead of: graphic designer, dog lover</li>

                    <li class="list-indent">Try: graphic designer who loves dogs</li>
                    <li>Once you have the basic and factual section completed, break into a new sentence and space it down. Then add in a humorous bio of your choice, preferably one that sounds like it will belong with the above sentence. If the joke is strong enough it usually will</li>
                    <li>Once you’ve completed this step, your bio will pretty much be as strong as it can get, but there is a little more that can be done</li>
                    <li>Linking your Instagram account it isn’t completely necessary but if done right, will strengthen your profile</li>
                    <li>Don’t link your page if it’s controversial in any way</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">A lot of girls</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Drinking excessively</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Drugs</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Your political or religious or sports related beliefs</li>
                    <li>Basically if any pictures on your Instagram page wouldn’t work well in your actual photo section, don’t link your account</li>

                    <li>In the grand scheme of things, what makes up a good Instagram account is a whole others conversation. This is elaborated on more in instructions designed specifically for Instagram</li>

                <h3>Incase you’re still struggling</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>If you’re still struggling with the bio, here are a couple of tips</li>
                    <li>If you’re not ecstatic about your occupation/schooling or think it doesn’t sound interesting, just leave it out and rely on the strength of humor or your hobbies and interests</li>
                    <li>If your life as a whole isn’t really that interesting then just solely rely on humor. If you can get her to laugh, you’re pretty much in</li>
                    <li>Contrary to popular belief, most people’s lives are actually interesting enough to fill out one to two sentences. But if you still aren’t able to figure out what’s interesting about you, then just grab a sheet of paper and interview a couple of people close to you (friends or family)</li>

                    <li>Just ask them what factual details they find significant about you, write them down and pick from those</li>
                    <li>If you don’t feel like interviewing people or you’re not in fact close to literally anyone, grab a sheet of paper and start listing things you like. Sooner or later you’ll find something to put down</li>
                    <li>If you want to come up with your own humorous section of the bio and are lacking inspiration</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Look up funny twitter accounts and try and emulate their sense of humor</li>

                    <li class="list-indent">Do the same while watching standup comedy</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Look up funny quotes or jokes</li>
                    <li>In the end the bio isn’t really something to stress out about as long as the rest of your profile is strong; its basically just icing on the cake</li>
