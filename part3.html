                <h3>The First Message: Introduction</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>Close your eyes and picture a girl walking down the street and think of what would be the first thing you would do to get her undivided attention</li>
                    <li>The catch is that she is surrounded by hundreds of other guys with the exact same objective in mind</li>
                    <li>This is the real world equivalent to sending out you first message</li>
                    <li>When sending out the first message otherwise known as the “opener”, you become one of presumably hundreds of individuals competing for attention

                    </li>
                    <li>While most would see this as a disadvantage, its actually an opportunity

                    </li>
                    <li>The thing is that most of the people you’re competing with are going to fail immediately</li>
                    <li>In this portion we will study the science and theory behind the opener by looking at all the most common mistakes that nearly everyone makes and how to succeed at starting your conversations</li>




                </ul>



            </section>





            <section id="science">
                <h3>The First Message: The Science Behind It</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first message is at times set in its own category apart from the rest of the conversation because it has a very singular purpose, get the girl to respond</li>
                    <li>Although it can be used to set the tone for the conversation, in most cases it becomes irrelevant after its played its part</li>
                    <li>The beauty of the first message is that you have an endless variety of options, making it very simple to tailor a custom message that can be used time and time again</li>
                    <li>As with everything else you want to put a good amount of thought into your first message but in turn, you want to know when it’s time to move on from it and exhaust your energy on other more important things
                    </li>
                    <li>Once you have found one that work for you, you’re going to want to move on from the subject, only going back to tweak it if you you see a negative change in your response rate</li>
                    <li>Again don’t exhaust all your energy coming up with an excessive amount of openers</li>
                    <li>You will never find a flawless opener that get a 100% response rate</li>
                    <li>You’re goal should be to get a response rate of over 50%</li>
                    <li>Anything less than that and your opener needs to be revised</li>
                    <li>Just keep testing it until you find one that works</li>
                    <li>The foundation of all your interactions should be framed around emotion in any way possible, this is a critical aspect of the opener</li>
                </ul>
            </section>




            <section id="nottodo">
                <h3>The First Message: What Not To do</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Although you have a wide variety to choose from there’s a couple of things you’re going to want to avoid that have been proven to fail</li>


                    <li>The undisputed most common mistake that nearly everyone makes when sending out the first message is being generic</li>
                    <li>You are trying to get her attention, if everyone is doing the same thing as you are then you’ve immediately failed</li>
                    <li>So what’s the one thing that people say the most?</li>
                    <li>A simple greeting</li>
                    <li>Hey</li>

                    <li class="list-indent">Hi</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">What’s up?</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">How’s it going?</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Hey, it nice to meet you</li>
                    <li>Nearly every girls tinder profile is flooded with messages like these from hundreds of guys</li>
                    <li>The odds of getting a response with an opener like this are slim to none

                    </li>
                    <li>In the unlikely case that the girl does respond, it’s setting a very dull tone for the rest of the conversation</li>
                    <li>Another common mistake when opening is the simple complement</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Wow, you’re gorgeous</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Hey, you’re really cute</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Best bio ever</li>
                    <li>Again with an opener like this, the main reason it doesn’t work is because too many people are doing it</li>
                    <li>The other reason is that it isn’t genuine</li>
                    <li>A simple complement that can be repeated to every other person is going to elicit any emotion</li>
                    <li>Though it can be seen as a good way to start a conversation asking a basic question doesn’t usually get a response either</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">What are you up to tonight?</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Enjoy the weekend?</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Where are you from?</li>
                    <li>Like most openers, everyone is using it, making you fade into the masses

                    </li>
                    <li>Questions like these are also to dull to get a response</li>
                    <li>The logistical opener is another commonly used one that you should try and avoid</li>
                    <li>This is the kind of opener that tries to justify messaging the girl with logic

                    </li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Hey, I grew up in Detroit too!</li>

                    <li class="list-indent">Look, it says we’re only 2 miles away</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">How do you know Cody?</li>
                    <li>The issue with this opener is that it lacks emotion due to the fact that its targeting logic</li>
                    <li>This turns the conversation into an interview</li>
                    <li>Being flirtatious can work well in some cases, but used un-genuinely, it will probably fail</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Lets play</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">This looks like its going to be fun</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">What’s a cute girl like you doing on tinder?</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">You look like trouble</li>

                    <li>This applies to using emojis that are smiley faces or winking face or most emojis in general</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Unless used sarcastically or as a part of a joke</li>


                    <li>A lot of users try to jump the gun immediately by asking to meet up or for the phone number in their opener. This will fail</li>
                    <li>No one is going to meet up with you or give you their number without having talked to you</li>
                    <li>Being blatantly sexual or crude in your opener may work occasionally but not nearly enough to make it worth using</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Avoid any extremes</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Wanna fuck?</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Well, you look do-able</li>

                    <li>This type of opener only works if you are using humor to give light to the fact that you’re being ridiculous</li>
                    <li>Slightly better that being blatant but still not good enough, is being cocky

                    </li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Don’t make me work for it</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Congratulations, you hit the jackpot</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Aren’t you going to message me?</li>
                    <li>This type of opener will get some responses, but not as many as you’d like

                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors</li>
                    <li>Refrain from using any abbreviations like LOL, U, R, etc.</li>

                    <li>Not the most common but hands down the worst mistake you can make in your opener is not sending one at all</li>
                    <li>It’s very rare that the girl will message you first and if it doesn’t happen with in the first few minutes of matching its not going to happen at all</li>
                    <li>If you want to succeed at this, you have to take initiative</li>
                    <li>You’ll miss out on every opportunity you don’t take</li>

            <section id="panic">
                <h3>The First Message: The Panic Opener</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The panic opener is one of the most ideal ways to make yourself stand out and get a response</li>
                    <li>With the scenario in mind that the girl is walking down the street and you have to get her attention, the first thought that comes to mind is to literally call out for it as if your life depended on it</li>
                    <li>So if your life did depend on it would you just say hello?</li>
                    <li>Of course not. If your life depended on it you would create a sense of urgency

                    </li>
                    <li>Hence the panic opener</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Help!</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Ah!</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Call 911!</li>
                    <li>While most use the opener to try and create attraction, those who use the panic opener come out ahead because they understand that the opener’s sole purpose is to get the girl to respond. The chemistry will come later</li>

                </ul>
            </section>




            <section id="question">
                <h3>The First Message: The Question</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The question is pretty self explanatory, ask a question</li>
                    <li>Again, refrain from using the basic stuff</li>
                    <li>Use the question as a method of making her qualify</li>
                    <li>When someone qualifies it basically means that they are trying to give you reason as to why you should be interested in them</li>
                    <li>This works well because it changes the dynamic of the conversation to where the girl develops the need to prove herself</li>
                    <li>This will be discussed further later on</li>

                </ul>
            </section>




            <section id="statement">
                <h3>The First Message: The Statement</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The statement is hands down the most complex and broad category of openers, but it has the potential to be the most effective</li>

                    <li>The main strategy behind this is to elicit out right emotion</li>
                    <li>Whether it be through humor, shock, confusion, etc.</li>


                    <li>“Name, I love you” and “name, I hate you” are the two openers that have so far had the best response rate, both being above 90%. “Name, I hate you” is slightly more successful</li>
                    <li>Both these statement elicit extremely strong emotions</li>
                    <li>Another way to use the statement opener is through humor</li>
                    <li>The only way to know if people will find a joke funny is to test it for yourself

                    </li>

                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="personal">
                <h3>The First Message: The Personal Message</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The personal message is the type of opener where you go to the girls profile and find something about it to tailor an opener specifically for her

                    </li>
                    <li>Although the personal message is just as effective as some of the other openers, it is the most time consuming</li>
                    <li>Having to go through each matches profile and tailor an opener specifically for each one at time may not be worth effort</li>
                    <li>But if you fabricate a reusable template where you’ll only need to search for broad details in their profile, you’ll save a lot of time</li>
                    <li>For example, the template consist of two parts</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">The compliment</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">The disqualifier</li>
                    <li>Search for something in her profile that you like, then search for something that could be used as a reason for a relationship between you two not working out</li>
                    <li>Now combine those two by outing a “but” in the middle</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Although you have a really cute smile, I have a chronic fear of vampires, so I don’t know if this is going to work out</li>
                    <li>This works well because the initial complement sets a light hearted tone, but the second part gives the girl the need to qualify herself</li>



                </ul>
            </section>


            <section id="pickup">
                <h3>The First Message: The Pickup Line</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The pickup line is a tricky opener due to the fact that most people use it poorly</li>
                    <li>Traditional pickup lines are usually unsuccessful, but there is a slightly different way to use them so that they do work</li>
                    <li>What most people do is us a pickup line with the intention of actually “picking up” the girl</li>
                    <li>This fails because it’s un-genuine and comes across as cheesy</li>
                    <li>A more appropriate way to use a pickup line is with the intent to make her laugh</li>
                    <li>For starters, a girl isn’t going to laugh at a pickup line she’s already heard

                    <li>So don’t make the obvious mistake of using a pickup line that everyone knows</li>
                    <li>Are you from Tennessee? Cause you’re the only ten I see</li>
                    <li>Did it hurt? When you fell from heaven</li>
                    <li>Try and follow the guideline that if you’ve heard it from more than one person, she probably has too</li>
                    <li>The first approach you can take when using a pickup line is that if you firmly believe it’s unique, then it’ll probably work</li>

                    <li>Another approach that can be taken when using pickup lines is to create a variation of an overused one</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Are you from Tennessee? Cause I wanna make-out with your face

                    </li>

                <h3>Structure of the Conversation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The structure within the conversation can be simplified though four ends of a spectrum</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Humor</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Negative</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Positive</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Logistics</li>
                    <li>The negative and positive are the emotional ends as for the humor and logistics are the conversational ends</li>
                    <li>The structure of a tinder consists of 2 variables, you and your match</li>
                    <li>Within the interaction the conversation will fluctuate between the 4 spectrums depending on where the 2 of you lead it</li>

                    <li>Each both you and your match usual have a specific goal</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Your goal should be to try and get the phone number</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Her goal varies from person to person but you can usually tell what it is depending on the conversation</li>
                    <li>To achieve you’re goal you’ll need to move the conversation into that direction

                    </li>
                    <li>The phases of the conversation you will go through to get there are as follows

                    </li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Opener</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">Calibration (identifying her blueprint)</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">The narrative</li>

                    <li class="list-indent">The close</li>
                    <li>Not all of these phases are set in stone</li>
                    <li>Some conversations open then skip right to the number (very few)</li>
                    <li>With that said these are the general steps you should be taking</li>

                <h3>The Blueprint (Calibration)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is important to realize that not everyone responds to all the ends of the spectrum in the same way</li>
                    <li>There is not ideal individual that was raised in the perfect circumstances where emotional impact from the outside world has no effect on them</li>
                    <li>Vice-versa there’s no one person who was brought up under the most horrific of circumstances where even the smallest grain of self acceptance cant be found within them</li>
                    <li>These are totalities that humans just don’t fit into</li>
                    <li>But it is also important to figure out which ends of the spectrum your match leans closer to</li>
                    <li>A persons blue print is the structure of who someone is, based on what they resonate with</li>
                    <li>Figuring out your matches blueprint will drastically aid you. This is called calibrating</li>
                    <li>Everyone responds to things in their own way, it’s your job to figure out what that way is</li>

            <section id="narrative">
                <h3>The Narrative</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The narrative is basically the meat of the interaction</li>
                    <li>After you open and calibrate, the narrative is the dialog will build up to the close</li>
                    <li>It’s main purpose is to build comfort and attraction between you and your match</li>
                    <li>Basically a way for the girl to see if she would actually enjoy meeting you

                    </li>
                    <li>The narrative can range from one message to back and forth that is seemingly endless</li>
                    <li>As Albert Einstein said, “everything must be made as simple as possible but not simpler”</li>
                    <li>You want to keep it as brief as you can but never rush it</li>
                    <li>The narrative should basically be view as a story that you and your match write together</li>
                    <li>In most cases you will be leading the story because leading exhaust energy and if the your match has to exhaust any energy over a tinder conversation, she’s going to drop it</li>

                    <li>The context of the narrative is going to be a balance between negative/positive and humor/logistics text, this is where push/pull theory comes into play</li>
                    <li>Push/pull theory is what you use when keeping the balance of the narrative while you lead it to its intended direction</li>
                    <li>For example you would push the conversation into logistics, if she doesn’t respond well, you would pull it back to humor</li>

                </ul>

            <section id="emotion">
                <h3>The Narrative: Eliciting Emotion Through Validation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The need to be accepted is the foundation of all human emotion</li>
                    <li>The root cause of people spending their whole lives in search of “success” is due to their need for validation</li>
                    <li>Although some people find the ability to validate themselves through internal acceptance, the majority of people are usually looking for it in the external world</li>
                    <li>Our ability to accept ourselves or our need for acceptance from others can usually be pinpointed to what occurred during childhood</li>
                    <li>As Sigmund Freud said “I can’t think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for fathers protection”</li>
                    <li>If our childhood dictates our action in adulthood this idea is the foundation of our entire structure</li>
                    <li>The “father” in this case can be designated to whoever cared for us or should have cared for us as a child</li>
                    <li>Those who where given sufficient care, spend less time looking for it in other because they have learned that because they where given love they are deserving of it, in turn they will provide it for themselves regardless of whether or not the outside world gives it to them</li>
                    <li>As Stephen Chbosky said “we accept the love we think we deserve”</li>
                    <li>This doesn’t mean that everyone who had a dysfunctional relationship with their parents is doomed to an endless search for validation</li>
                    <li>Many people do in fact find it within themselves regardless, it just comes at a later point in life</li>
                    <li>But in a lot of cases, people wont find appreciation for a good deep unless they have been wronged beforehand</li>
                    <li>This is the reason that outright compliments tend to fail</li>
                    <li>If you just tell a girl she’s cute, she wont find any value in the statement because she doesn’t feel like she’s earned your acceptance</li>
                    <li>To her you become one of the hundreds of guys who views her on the pedestal she doesn’t feel like she belongs on</li>
                    <li>Going deeper into this, it’s reinforced by our societal need to want what we can’t have and not want what we can have</li>
                    <li>You cant make the girl feel like she already “has you”</li>
                    <li>As M. Kathleen Casey said “there’s a basic human weakness inherent in all people which tempts them to want what they can’t have and not want what is already available to them”</li>
                    <li>The disclaimer you want to keep in mind id that this concept has to be balanced out</li>
                    <li>This is the negative end of the spectrum</li>

                </ul>

            <section id="love">
                <h3>The Narrative: Eliciting Emotion Through love</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>As stated earlier, the need to be accepted is the foundation of human emotion

                    </li>
                    <li>That brings up the question, what is the aftermath of acceptance</li>
                    <li>The answer is simple. Love</li>
                    <li>Love is the strongest and most innate emotion, the only one that doesn’t have to be taught because we’re all born seeking it</li>
                    <li>If the goal of the conversation is to elicit emotion, love should be your main focus</li>
                    <li>If you are eliciting emotion through validation, then love is the best way to balance that out</li>
                    <li>Love is the general theme that you want to carry out throughout the conversation

                    </li>
                    <li>The reason you want to create a need for validation is because when it is balanced out with love, the emotion will have a stronger impact</li>
                    <li>You need the bad to appreciate the good</li>
                    <li>This is the positive end of the spectrum</li>

            <section id="humor">
                <h3>The Narrative: Humor Within The Conversation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The humorous aspect of the conversation is key</li>
                    <li>As Marilyn Monroe said “if you can get a girl to laugh you can make her do anything”</li>
                    <li>The catch is that making a girl laugh, especially on tinder, is a lot easier said than done</li>
                    <li>What you want to convey through your humor is that you don’t take thing too seriously</li>
                    <li>This will show that you are not dependent on any specific outcome and will take a lot of the pressure off of the conversation</li>
                    <li>The best way to figure out what is funny is too just test things out</li>
                    <li>To hold the girls attention, you need to provide some form of entertainment and humor is the best way to do that</li>
                    <li>In most cases, humor needs to be spontaneous and unforced. But the beauty of communicating through text is that this doesn’t really apply</li>
                    <li>As you have more and more conversations, this will become a lot easier because once you find a line that work you can always reuse it</li>
                    <li>People always ask “how do I make myself funny?” and the simplest answer to the expose yourself to comedy</li>
                    <li>What standup, what funny TV shows or movies. Over time you will grow an understanding for what resonates with people</li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>

            <section id="logistics">
                <h3>The Narrative: Logistics Within The Conversation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The logistics of the conversation are the factual details</li>
                    <li>Above all logistics is the most necessary aspect of the conversation</li>
                    <li>It need to be there to have any successful interactions</li>
                    <li>A conversation wont got anywhere if you cant ask for the number or setup a date</li>

                    <li>The downside to this is that people mostly refrain from thinking logically

                    </li>
                    <li>Humans are emotional creatures not logistical ones</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">For example, someone stuck in traffic will beep their horn at the person in front of the person in front of them as a response to the traffic</li>
                    <li class="list-indent">With logistical reasoning, this person would realize that beeping the horn wont make the traffic speed up. But in emotional situations, emotion trumps logistics</li>
                    <li>This is why you want to keep logistics o the bare necessities</li>
                    <li>Unless the girl shifts the conversation toward the logistics herself, try to do it only when necessary</li>

            <section id="roleplay">
                <h3>The Narrative: Role-Play</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Probably the strongest method of building a successful narrative is through role play</li>
                    <li>With role-play, you provide an experience. The girl will feel a sense of attachment through the story that you’ve created with her</li>
                    <li>It doesn’t matter how ridiculous the narrative get as long as she goes along with it</li>
                    <li>This brings up the topic of unity within the narrative</li>
                    <li>The what you want to accomplish through the story it turning you and me into us</li>

                    <li>You want to create a sense of unity, as if the two of you are in this together

                    </li>
                    <li>This will strengthen the sense of attachment that the girl has to the narrative

                    </li>
                    <li>Even though you both know that the story is fictitious, people still want to be a part of the fantasy that society sells them</li>
                    <li>So what you want to ask yourself is “what is the fantasy that people want to be a part of?”</li>
                    <li>Again the answers pretty clear. Love people want to think they’re in love

                    </li>
                    <li>This is another reason you want to push the narrative in that direction</li>

            <section id="shittest">
                <h3>The Narrative: Shit Test</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Throughout your interactions you’re going to come across frequent amount of “shit tests”</li>
                    <li>Before we discuss what a shit test is, and how to handle it, we need to acknowledge its purpose</li>
                    <li>The reason a girl will give you a shit test is basically to see if you “get it”

                    </li>
                    <li>For example a good photographer “gets it”. What that mean is that through practice and experience, he’s grown an ethereal understanding for what makes a good photograph</li>
                    <li>This would be difficult to put into words, because to understand what he’s would be talking about, you would have to “get it” too</li>
                    <li>Just like photography, this concept also applies to socializing</li>

                    <li>This “it” is an extremely delicate concept that is shown through your words and actions that can be recognized by someone else who “gets it”

                    </li>
                    <li>It is basically showing a that you have social intuitiveness for how an interaction with two people needs to go</li>
                    <li>Just like you would trust a photographer who knows what he’s doing when taking a picture, a girl will trust and want to get to know you if you can prove the you “get it”</li>
                    <li>This concept will be conveyed clearly to the girl if you follow the previous guidelines, but in a lot of cases the girl will test you herself</li>
                    <li>This is called a “shit test”</li>

                </ul>
            </section>


            <section id="variations">
                <h3>The Narrative: Shit Test Variations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You’re going to come across a variety of shit tests and the over arching theme of how to handle them is to just ignore them</li>
                    <li>The sexual advance: when a girl makes an overly sexual remark, don’t get too excited, she’s most likely testing you so just either don’t acknowledge it and change the subject or call her out playfully on being vulgar</li>
                    <li>Gibberish: a lot of times the girl will say things that just don’t make sense, again just ignore it and continue the conversation</li>
                    <li>You may want to use a line like “yea, so anyway”</li>
                    <li>Disinterest: a lot of times the girl will act disinterested or play hard to get by giving short un-engaging responses. Either playfully call her out or just ignore it</li>
                    <li>A shit test is in some ways a girl seeing if you need her validation</li>

                    <li>One of the most attractive traits someone can have is being able to show that you don’t need the validation of other people</li>
                    <li>So by ignoring it or calling it out, you are showing that you are above the need for validation</li>
                    <li>Not so much a shit test as just nothing at all, is the situation if she stops responding</li>
                    <li>Give it two to three days, then if she still doesn’t respond send an emotional call for attention such as “what are you doing, you’re supposed to fight for me"</li>

            <section id="proper">
                <h3>The Narrative: Using Proper language</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>An extremely strong too that can be used pretty much at any point in the interaction is incorporating proper language</li>
                    <li>Certain words are predisposed to trigger certain behavioral responses</li>
                    <li>Like when building the narrative you create the us mentality by using words like “we” as opposed to “you”</li>
                    <li>Use words to paint a picture off what the future between the two of you will look like</li>
                    <li>Assume attraction with statements “just picture it…” encourage the girl to visualize a future</li>
                    <li>But above all, the one word that people respond to the most is their name

                    </li>
                    <li>As humans we are groomed our entire lives to form an identity around who society tells us we are</li>
                    <li>This identity can be summed up within our name</li>
                    <li>When you hear your name, your train of thought is triggered to devote attention

                    </li>
                    <li>Things get as personal as they possible can because you are identifying someone as their own person, apart from everyone else</li>
                    <li>It’s very empowering to the relationship because it says “you are your own person and I am acknowledging that”</li>
                    <li>It makes her feel that she is special and you are smart enough to recognize it</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>As the interaction comes full circle, the time will come where you need to close and ask for the number</li>
                    <li>Closing is a lot simpler than people think</li>
                    <li>If you build up the narrative enough it will be implied that this is going somewhere further</li>
                    <li>Then all you have to do is ask for the number in a light hearted way</li>
                    <li>In some cases their will be resistance so you’ll have to justify it a bit more or continue the narrative then try again later</li>
