                    <li>Now that you have all the knowledge on how to maximize your results, it’s time to make a game plan</li>
                    <li>The first thing you’re going to want to do id make sure profile matches all the criteria previously explained before going into discovery settings and activating the “show me in discovery” switch</li>
                    <li>Once you’re at this point, it’s time to start swiping</li>

                <h3>Swiping</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you’re just starting out, swipe right on literally everyone</li>
                    <li>If you interact with a large amount of people as opposed to just the ones you are attracted to</li>
                    <li>Don’t wait till your attracted to someone to get good at this. When that person comes along you’re going to want to have the skill already</li>
                    <li>Many would advocate that the time of day that you swipe, would affect your matches. It won’t, so just swipe whenever you want</li>

                    <li>If you rapidly swipe and get matched with someone you don’t have any interest in the just delete them</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>The conversation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once you start conversations that you are investing time into, try and limit it to no more that 4 at a time but no less than 2</li>
                    <li>When you’re talking to more than one person at a time it helps to relieve the pressure you put on yourself</li>
                    <li>If all you’re eggs are in one basket, you’ll end up making irrational decisions due to the fact that you’ll put her on a pedestal</li>
                    <li>If you’re talking to more than 4, you’re bound to loose focus due to being overwhelmed</li>


                </ul>

            <section id="scripted">
                <h3>Scripted conversation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>As you progress you will start to have a better understanding for what works and what doesn’t</li>
                    <li>After a while you may notice that a lot of your conversations look the same

                    </li>
                    <li>It is perfectly normal to develop an informal script of what to say in certain cases due to the fact that you’re personality will intertwine with conditioned responses</li>

                    <li>You may find a specific opener that you use over and over and that’s perfectly fine and in the long run will save you a lot of time an mental energy

                    </li>

            <section id="plus">
                <h3>Tinder plus</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the most prevalent questions about tinder has to be “is tinder plus worth it”</li>
                    <li>And the answer is yes, but not for the reasons you’re thinking</li>
                    <li>Tinder plus will not get you more matches</li>
                    <li>Though you have unlimited swipes your card is still shown to the same amount of people. So swiping more wont make a difference</li>

                    <li>If you aren’t getting any matches the issue is in your profile not how many times you’re swiping right</li>
                    <li>One of things that can justify tinder plus is location</li>
                    <li>If you are not in an abundant city the fact of the matter is that they’re aren’t enough people around for you to swipe on</li>
                    <li>The only way to solve this is to et tinder plus and change your location to a city near you that is more abundant</li>
